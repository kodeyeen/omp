# omp
omp is a Go package that allows you to write open.mp gamemodes.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/kodeyeen/omp
```

## Requirements

- `GCC/G++` go build tool will require you to have C and C++ 32 bit compilers available on your system.

Type `gcc -v` and `g++ -v` in your terminal and you should see something like this:

```
Target: i686-w64-mingw32
```

Note the i686. Otherwise it won't build.

## Quickstart

1. Initialize a go module with `go mod init <YOUR MODULE NAME>`.
2. Write some basic gamemode.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/kodeyeen/omp"
)

// Gamemode entry point
func init() {
	// Listen to some predefined event
	omp.ListenFunc(omp.EventTypePlayerConnect, func(ctx context.Context, e omp.Event) error {
		ep := e.Payload().(*omp.PlayerConnectEvent)
		// Send client message to the connected player
		ep.Player.SendClientMessage("Hello, world!", 0xFFFF00FF)
		return nil
	})
}

// You MUST declare the main function, otherwise it fails to build
// You shouldn't write any code here
func main() {}

```

3. Build it depending on your system (see the section below).
4. Add the compiled file to the `gamemodes` folder of your server.
5. Install and configure the [Gomponent](https://github.com/kodeyeen/gomponent).

Now if you run the server and connect to it you should see the message "Hello, world!"

## Building

On Windows:

```powershell
$env:GOARCH=386; $env:CGO_ENABLED=1; go build -buildmode=c-shared -o build\gamemode.dll
```

On Linux:

```bash
GOARCH=386 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -buildmode=c-shared -o build/gamemode.so
```

If you're using `Visual Studio Code` and seeing error messages during development, this is because of your `GOARCH` and `CGO_ENABLED` env variable values.
You can check them by typing:

```shell
go env
```

If `GOARCH` value is something different than `386` and `CGO_ENABLED` is `0` this is the cause of those error messages.
You can set them permanently to be `386` and `1` respectively by typing:

```shell
go env -w GOARCH=386
```

```shell
go env -w CGO_ENABLED=1
```

Or you could create a `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following contents:

```json
{
    "go.toolsEnvVars": {
        "GOARCH": "386",
        "CGO_ENABLED": "1"
    }
}
```

Now you don't need to set these variables every time you open your project.
